# Header

The header component is used to display the header of a page. It contains the University of Guelph logo and links to various resources.

## Usage

### Basic

<Canvas of={HeaderStories.Basic} sourceState="shown" />

### With Topic/Category Title

Sometimes the header is being used on pages that belong together in a group, or are being used in web pages that belong to a specific department of the University. In these cases the header provides a way to make it clear to the end user that these pages belong together by showing the name of the department/topic in the sub navigation.

<Canvas of={HeaderStories.WithPageTitle} sourceState="shown" />

The title can also act as a link, typically leading to the homepage of the topic/category.

<Canvas of={HeaderStories.WithPageLink} sourceState="shown" />

### With Sub Navigation Links and Menus

The header also allows for a collection of links and dropdowns to be displayed within the sub navigation.

This pairs well with the topic/category title, allowing for a more detailed navigation experience.

<Canvas of={HeaderStories.WithSubNavigation} sourceState="shown" />

**Note:** Currently, nested dropdowns will render as if they were not nested at all.
